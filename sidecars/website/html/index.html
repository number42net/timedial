    <h1>Welcome to TimeDial.org</h1>
    <p><strong>TimeDial.org</strong> is a public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS</a>-style system that you can access through a browser (coming soon), SSH, Telnet, or a raw TCP socket.</p>
    <p>Whether you're logging in with a modern terminal or a real vintage setup, TimeDial lets you explore a shell environment, play classic games, and even run authentic vintage software on simulated machines like the PDP-11 and VAX.</p>
    <p>TimeDial is built with true vintage compatibility in mind. The interface dynamically adapts to both 40- and 80-column displays, meaning it works just as well on a real terminal as on a modern terminal emulator. It's also optimized for slow connections and remains usable even at 1200 baud.</p>

    <h2>How to Connect</h2>
    <p>Connect using any of the following ports with the username <code>guest</code> and the password <code>guest</code>. The system will guide you through creating a new account. Once that's done, simply log in again using your personal username and password.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>22 - SSH</strong> (recommended; use with <a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a> or similar)</li>
        <li><strong>23 - Telnet</strong></li>
        <li><strong>24 - Raw TCP</strong> (least ideal, but useful for serial-to-TCP bridges or vintage terminals)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Privacy Note:</strong> While passwords are encrypted on the server, Telnet and raw TCP connections transmit credentials in plain text. Don't store anything important on the server and use a unique password you don't use elsewhere.</p>

    <h2>What You'll Find Inside</h2>
    <p>The platform is still in its early stages, but already offers:</p>

    <h3>Classic Simulated Hardware</h3>
    <p>Run real software on simulated vintage systems. Always wanted to try out BSD UNIX but don't have a PDP-11 lying around? Now's your chance!</p>
    <p>Each simulator runs as a private instance, with disk images and configuration files stored in your personal home directory. That means full control - modify your setup, log in from multiple terminals, and pick up right where you left off.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>PDP-11/70</strong> with 2.11BSD  </li>
        <li><strong>VAX 8600</strong> with OpenVMS 7.1  </li>
        <li>Want something else? Let us know!</li>
    </ul>
